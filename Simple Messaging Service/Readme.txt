Overview:

A project I created for my Software Integration and Engineering course. The original project requirements are in the attached pdf. The project here is Assignment 5.

The project consisted of using an xml file as a database for storing messages. The WebApp would display the messages from a specified user and could delete messages from a specified user. The WebApp needed to call an API I created to handle communication with the xml database.

Messaging Service:
implemented using WCF service converted to RESTFUL service
Target framework: .NET Framework 4.6.1
Named Assignment_5

WebApp:
Implemented using MVC
Target framework: .NET Core 2.1
Named MsgApp

Notes:

I ran these locally using the same process used to run self-hosting service.
